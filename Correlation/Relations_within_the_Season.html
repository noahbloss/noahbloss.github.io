    <h1>Relations within the Season</h1>
    <h5> This Page shows the Correlation between the different Sabermetrics within the Season over the Years. 
    To have a better oversight over the Correlation Coefficients, the Table with all Coefficients is provided in 
    <a href="Correlation_Table.html">Correlation Tables</a>. 
    The first Plots, before the horizontal rule, are created with Data drawn from pitchers with at least 300 pitches. 
    After that the same Plots are displayed, except the Plots were created with Data drawn from Pitchers with at least 1750 pitches.
